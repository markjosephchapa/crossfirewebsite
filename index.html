<h1>游꿡 Gameplay</h1>
<p><em>CrossFire</em> is a free-to-play first-person shooter that features two mercenary corporations named the <strong>"Black List"</strong> and <strong>"Global Risk,"</strong> fighting each other in an epic global conflict. Players assume the role of either a Black List or Global Risk mercenary, joining an online team that must work together to complete objective-based scenarios. Except for the Zombie mode and Wave mode, each mode can support a maximum of 16 players, each divided into an 8-man team.<br></p>

<p>Players progress and eventually be promoted through various Military Ranks, beginning at trainee, with the highest being Marshall. Players can also customize their character's equipment and appearance through in-game items.
CrossFire has a free currency which is called Game Points (GP), which is earned through playing and completing matches, buying premium items that grant bonus GP, or fulfilling certain missions. Premium and special items like modified weapons can only be bought using monetary currencies. The content tends to vary from version to version.<br></p>

<h1>游깷 Modes</h1>
<p>CrossFire features several game modes, each with unique maps and rules.<br></p>
<h3>仇됪eam Deathmatch</h3>
<p>Teams work towards goals, such as first to x many kills, or the team with the most kills.</p>
<h3>仇됩earch & Destroy</h3>
<p>Black List's objective is to plant and detonate a C4 charge in a designated spot or kill all of the Global Risk players. Global Risk's objective is to eliminate all Black List players or prevent Black List from planting and detonating the charge within the match's time limit. Players do not respawn. Rounds last up to 3 minutes.</p>
<h3>仇됝ree for All</h3>
<p>No teams, teams kill as many players as possible. Players respawn at different locations. The round ends when a player reaches the kill quota for the match or the timer runs out. Weapon restrictions exist for this mode.</p>
<h3>仇된limination</h3>
<p>Similar to TDM, except players do not respawn when killed. In some maps, players start only with their melee weapons and must pick up guns pre-set in the map. Rounds last up to three minutes, with Global Risk defaulting in wins.</p>
<h3>仇됩uppression Mode</h3>
<p>A new, and much faster Search and Destroy. Each Black List player gets a bomb, and spawns only a few metres from the bomb plant site. The Global Risk must storm their defenses and disarm the bomb before it detonates.</p>
<h3>仇됞host Mode</h3>
<p>All Black List mercenaries have invisibility and melee weapons, while all Global Risk mercenaries are fully visible, but can use all available weapons. Black List emits a heavy breathing sound, footsteps, splashes while running through water, and also become significantly visible while moving.</p>
<h3>仇됩hadow Mode</h3>
<p>A variant of Ghost Mode. A player becomes a Shadow warrior which is an advanced ghost character. This mode introduces security devices such as Sensors, Lasers and Sprinklers to track down the Shadow warriors. In this map, there are certain parts of the floors which are covered with different textures (including broken glass) that will make more noise than others, making it easier for the Mercenary Soldiers to hear the Shadow Warrior movements.</p>
<h3>仇됤utation Mode</h3>
<p>One or two players are infected and mutated 20 seconds into the round. When the time is up or all mutants are dead, the soldiers win. If all the soldiers mutate or die, the mutants win. Mutants are knocked backwards when shot.</p>
<hr>
<h1>游논 Characters</h1>
<p>Characters are the avatar of players and are what they will look like while playing in the game. A note is that while all characters are visually unique from each other, they are all functionally the same with no real advantages or disadvantages from each other in terms of stats, apart from a few limited-edition characters who are, for example; able to see better through smoke or reduce the visual incapacitating effects of flash bang grenades.<em>emphasize.<br></p>

<hr>
<h1>游댥 Weapons</h1>
<p><em>CrossFire</em> features weapons based on real-life models, with each weapon belonging to a category. Categories include machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, etc. Each category is functionally similar to their real world counterparts (Ex. Machine guns are heavy, powerful, lay down heavy fire and have long reload times, Submachine guns are lighter and fire faster but deal less damage, Shotguns are effective in close range but ineffective at long distance, etc.)<br></p>

<p>Weapons often have many variations, including different skins which give them different attributes. In addition, the re-skinned versions are often more rare. There are also some weapons which are different from other weapons like the VIP weapons, which have better functions like faster reload, among others. Certain modes have mode-exclusive weapons.</p>
