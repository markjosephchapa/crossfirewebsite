	<p>The M4A1-S TITANIUM Beast features a unique "breathing" obsidian beast design. It serves as a slightly upgraded variant of the M4A1-S Transformers, featuring more VVIP perks geared towards Zombie Mode and slightly better statistics.

	The Born Beast variant reloads faster and has less recoil, but draws slower than the Transformer. Also, both variants have the same secondary attack speed and the same rate of fire. It has the same ammunition capacity with 38/114 rounds (36/108 when dropped).</p>
